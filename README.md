# admin-dashboard
An admin dashboard utilizing Grid for The Odin Project Intermediate HTML and CSS module.

The goal of this project was to create the front-end for the main page of an admin dashboard. The main CSS concept I used for the project was grid. I also incorporated some flexbox which helped a ton for aligned icons in the project cards, as well as making the user profile chips in the trending tab.

Overall, I am happy with how this turned out! I have yet to learn true responsive design (that is later in the curriculum) so this project isn't 100% responsive on smaller screens, and most definitely is not mobile friendly. I tried my best to make it as responsive as possible using minmax and clamp functions where I could, and proritizing using relative units (like fr and %) instead of static units.
